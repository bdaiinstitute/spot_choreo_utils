# Adding Third Party Tools
If you develop a frontend UI, CLI, or other way to leverage the spot_choreo_utils library to create dances and would like to share that tool with the community, please:
  1. Create a new branch
  2. Add a new sub-folder under third_party for your project
  3. Create a README.md inside that folder that details its functionality, limitations, and includes any contact information for ongoing support.

The core spot_choreo_utils team does not extensivley test, validate or maintain code within the third_party folder.
